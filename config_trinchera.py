SMA_CASH_TRAILING_DISTANCE = 10.0  # Trailing stop distance after activation (e.g., 5 points from extreme)
# If SMA_CASH_TRAILING_ENABLED = True (and SMA_TRAILING_STOP = False):
#   - Initial SL: Fixed at SL_POINTS (10 points)
#   - When price moves SMA_CASH_TRAILING points in favor (e.g., 15 pts profit):
#     * Activate trailing stop at SMA_CASH_TRAILING_DISTANCE from extreme price
#     * Guarantees at least (SMA_CASH_TRAILING - SMA_CASH_TRAILING_DISTANCE) points profit
#     * Example: 15 - 5 = 10 points minimum profit locked in
#   - Final TP: Still at TP_POINTS (25 points)
#   - For LONG: When price rises 15pts → trail at highest_price - 5pts (locks 10pts min)
#   - For SHORT: When price drops 15pts → trail at lowest_price + 5pts (locks 10pts min)
#   - Exit reason: 'cash_trailing' if trailing stop hits, 'profit' if TP hits

# If SMA_TRAILING_STOP = True (only when FILTER_BY_SMA is also True):
#   - DISABLES fixed TP - lets profits run with dynamic trailing stop
#   - For LONG trades: SL = highest_price - TRAILING_STOP_ATR_MULT, moves UP only (never down)
#   - For SHORT trades: SL = lowest_price + TRAILING_STOP_ATR_MULT, moves DOWN only (never up)
#   - Trailing stop follows price movement with a volatility buffer (TRAILING_STOP_ATR_MULT points)
#   - Exit when price hits the trailing SL
#   - Exit reason will be 'trailing_stop' instead of 'stop'
#   - NO fixed TP is used when trailing stop is active (let profits run)
#   - NOTE: SMA is ONLY used for trade direction filtering, NOT for trailing stop calculation
#   - IMPORTANT: Trailing Stop OVERRIDES GRID_TP_POINTS when both GRID and Trailing Stop are enabled

#
#   WITHOUT Trailing Stop (SMA_TRAILING_STOP = False):
#     - If first entry reaches TP_POINTS before second entry triggers → close immediately at profit
#     - If second entry triggers → use GRID_TP_POINTS from average price, GRID_SL_POINTS beyond second entry
#
#   WITH Trailing Stop (SMA_TRAILING_STOP = True):
#     - Fixed TP is DISABLED for both first entry only AND second entry scenarios
#     - Only trailing stop is used (GRID_TP_POINTS is IGNORED)
